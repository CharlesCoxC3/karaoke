# Karaoke Finder

[Karaoke Finder](https://areas-boot-camp.github.io/karaoke/) is a music web application that gives karaoke lovers a way to search for the lyrics to their favorite songs.

We were motivated to build a simple search form that would let anyone who is about to sing their favorite song a way to prepare for their turn on the mic. This isn’t meant to replace a karaoke machine. Instead, it’s an easier way to find lyrics (better than googling and navigating multiple sites that might be bombarded with ads and spyware).

Our team learned a lot about how to use APIs to get and display data, and also how to display that data beautifully to the user.
